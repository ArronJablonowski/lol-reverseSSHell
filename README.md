# lol-reverseSSHell
Windows OS reverse shell over SSH

This script will install OpenSSH on Windows 10 via WindowsCapability. Copy the SSH private key and authorized_keys file to the proper locations on the Windows host. Then create a reverse SSH connection. The shell serves CMD.exe by default. Once you're in the cmd cli, you can type 'powershell' to get a PS shell.
